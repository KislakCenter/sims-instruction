### Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (SDBM)

> #### [Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (SDBM) website](https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/)
The SDBM aggregates observations of pre-modern manuscripts from historical and contemporary sources that document the sales and locations of these books from around the world. Entries in the SDBM assist researchers in locating and identifying particular manuscripts, establishing provenance, and collecting descriptive information about specific classes or types of manuscripts. SDBM user accounts are free and open to all, allowing users to contribute to the databaseâ€™s development by adding and linking entries, creating name and place authority files, and collaborating with other users on shared research interests. Our user community includes scholars, librarians, booksellers, students, collectors, and others who care about manuscripts and want to contribute to our shared knowledge of their histories.
