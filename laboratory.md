This is the Laboratory, in which you can find Tools to help you analyze manuscripts and share your findings.

### [Digital Beehive](https://kislakcenter.github.io/digital-beehive/)

>The Digital Beehive is a web interface that serves as both a digital representation and host of digital tools for researching and working with Pastorius’s manuscript and its system of cross-referencing.The Digital Beehive lies at the nexus of manuscript studies and digital humanities. Not quite an aggregated database nor a digital edition, this project pushes our understanding of the digital humanities in new directions, as our datasets ultimately serve to replicate, reveal, and share a hyperlinked data system developed by a single author in the Early Modern period in manuscript form.

### [DigitalMappa](https://www.digitalmappa.org/)

> DigitalMappa (DM) is an open-source DH platform for open-access workspaces, projects, collaborations, and scholarly publications. "The premise of DM is simple: if you have a collection of digital images and texts, then you should be able to develop a project where you can identify specific moments on these images and texts, annotate them as much as you want, link them together, generate searchable content, collaborate with your friends, and publish your work online for others to see and share." SIMS hosts [an instance of DM](https://sims2.digitalmappa.org/ "SIMS DM") with completed projects for you to view. If you need help understanding how to use DM, the [UW-Madison DM site](https://www.digitalmappa.org/ "UW-Madison DM") has a [Creator Guide](https://www.digitalmappa.org/creatorguide "Guide") for those getting started with a project. An introductory video tutorial on how to use DM will also be coming soon to this website. To request to begin a project on the SIMS DM instance, go to the [SIMS instance](https://sims2.digitalmappa.org/ "SIMS DM") and Register at the top right of the page.

### [Needham Calculator](http://www.needhamcalculator.net/)

> A calculator for diagnosing the category and format of 15th century paper.

### [Mapping Manuscript Migrations](https://mappingmanuscriptmigrations.org/en/)

[<img style="padding: 10px" align="right" width="200" src="/sims-instruction/images/mmm-logo.png" alt="MMMM Landing Page">](https://mappingmanuscriptmigrations.org/en "MMM Project Homepage")

>Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) is a semantic portal for finding and studying pre-modern manuscripts and their movements, based on linked collections of the [Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies](https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/), the [Bodleian Libraries](https://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/), and the [Institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes](http://bibale.irht.cnrs.fr/). The data have been combined using a set of shared ontologies and a novel unified Data Model that extends the CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo ontologies. A diagram of the Data Model can be seen [here](/sims-instruction/assets/MMM_Unified-Data-Model_Diagram.pdf). The original data have not been corrected or amended in any way, only aggregated from the legacy databases and transformed and linked into a global knowledge graph hosted in a linked open data service. The semantic portal MMM was created on top of the data service using its SPARQL API. If you would like to learn how to conduct SPARQL queries with this dataset, please see the SPARQL header in the [Classroom](/sims-instruction/classroom/).

### [Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (SDBM)](https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/)

[<img style="padding: 10px" align="right" width="200" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/pn6H0I4sS4Q/0.jpg" alt="Link to YouTube Introductory webinar">](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn6H0I4sS4Q "Introductory Webinar")

> The SDBM aggregates observations of pre-modern manuscripts from
historical and contemporary sources that document the sales and
locations of these books from around the world. Entries in the SDBM
assist researchers in locating and identifying particular manuscripts,
establishing provenance, and collecting descriptive information about
specific classes or types of manuscripts. SDBM user accounts are free
and open to all, allowing users to contribute to the database’s
development by adding and linking entries, creating name and place
authority files, and collaborating with other users on shared research
interests. Our user community includes scholars, librarians,
booksellers, students, collectors, and others who care about manuscripts
and want to contribute to our shared knowledge of their histories.

>  This [introductory webinar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn6H0I4sS4Q) provides a basic introduction to the database. It includes
an explanation of the SDBM's development history and data model,
followed by demonstrations of the user interface and search strategies.
Viewers will also learn how to contribute their own knowledge to the
database in the form of Personal Observations. This webinar was recorded
on May 19, 2020 with a live audience and includes their questions at the
end.

### [VisColl](https://viscoll.org/)

 [<img style="padding: 10px" align="right" width="200" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/TdPPcCIcSgk/0.jpg" alt="Tutorial on YouTube for building a collation model">](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPPcCIcSgk "VisColl Tutorial")

> VisColl (Collation Visualization) is a system for modeling and visualizing the physical collation of medieval manuscript codices. For an example of how the modeler looks in context, see [Lewis E 89](http://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/viewer.php?id=Lewis%20E%2089#page/1/mode/2up "Lewis E 89") a Book of Hours from the Free Library of Philadelphia. Click on the icon that looks like a stack of quires in the upper left (next to the gear icon) and the collation visualization will appear across the top of the screen. For more information see the [VisColl project website](https://viscoll.org/ "VisColl Site") or the [tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPPcCIcSgk "VisColl Tutorial").
