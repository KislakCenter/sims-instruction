> DigitalMappa (DM) is an open-source DH platform for open-access workspaces, projects, collaborations, and scholarly publications. "The premise of DM is simple: if you have a collection of digital images and texts, then you should be able to develop a project where you can identify specific moments on these images and texts, annotate them as much as you want, link them together, generate searchable content, collaborate with your friends, and publish your work online for others to see and share." SIMS hosts [an instance of DM](https://sims2.digitalmappa.org/) with completed projects for you to view. An introductory tutorial on how to use DM is coming soon. To request to begin a project on the SIMS DM instance, go to the [SIMS instance](https://sims2.digitalmappa.org/) and Register at the top right of the page.


### [VisColl](https://viscoll.org/)

> VisColl (Collation Visualization) is a system for modeling and visualizing the physical collation of medieval manuscript codices. For an example of how the modeler looks in context, see [Lewis E 89](http://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/viewer.php?id=Lewis%20E%2089#page/1/mode/2up) a Book of Hours from the Free Library of Philadelphia. Click on the icon that looks like a stack of quires in the upper left (next to the gear icon) and the collation visualization will appear across the top of the screen. For more information see the [VisColl project website](https://viscoll.org/) or the first tutorial linked on the right.
