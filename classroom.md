This is the Classroom, in which you can find resources to help you learn more about manuscripts at Penn and more generally. Listed below are Project-specific websites and YouTube videos, a Teach Yourself section with self-paced learning modules (more coming soon!) as well as links to two Lecture Series and the SIMS Journal.

#### [52 Discoveries in Philadelphia Manuscript Collections](https://bibliophilly.pacscl.org/category/fifty-two-discoveries/)

>This site is inspired by the [BiblioPhilly](http://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/) project and showcases discoveries made in those collections, one for each week of the year.

#### [Manuscript Video Orientations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8e3GREu0zuArF1rYG2JgKxWb_Kp_zmoT)

>This playlist on YouTube will give you a deeper look at a number of the manuscripts held in the Schoenberg Collection at the University of Pennsylvania.

### Teach Yourself

#### [Islamic Manuscript Basics](https://kislakcenter.github.io/islamicmss/)
[<img style="padding: 10px" align="right" height="100" src="/sims-instruction/images/basics.jpg" alt="Islamic manuscript headpiece with added title">](https://kislakcenter.github.io/islamicmss/ "Islamic Mss Basics")
>This site introduces novices to looking at Islamic manuscripts. Read through the pages in order and, if you like, take the mini-quizzes as you go.

#### [MMM SPARQL Tutorial](https://mapping-manuscript-migrations.github.io/mapping-manuscript-migrations.github.io//sparql/sparql_tutorial.html)

[<img style="padding: 10px" align="right" width="150" src="/sims-instruction/images/mmm-logo.png" alt="MMM Landing Page">](https://mapping-manuscript-migrations.github.io/mapping-manuscript-migrations.github.io//sparql/sparql_tutorial.html "SPARQL Tutorial")

> This tutorial provides the building blocks you will need to explore the Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) dataset using the SPARQL query language. You can construct far more complex queries using SPARQL than the faceted search provided by the general [MMM user interface](https://mappingmanuscriptmigrations.org/en/). Although the SPARQL language can intimidate the uninitiated, it's actually quite easy to use once you learn the basics of the syntax. The queries included in this tutorial can be customized by the user to suit any particular research interest. You should know a bit about the MMM project in general before embarking on the SPARQL tutorial: you can read more about it [here](https://mappingmanuscriptmigrations.org/en/about).

### Lecture Series

#### [Schoenberg Symposium Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchoenbergInstitute/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=13)
> YouTube playlists containing the last five years of lectures delivered at the Schoenberg Symposium. This annual symposium, organized in partnership with the Free Library of Philadelphia, brings together scholars from around the world and across disciplines to present research related to the study of manuscript books and documents produced before the age of printing and to discuss the role of digital technologies in advancing manuscript research. Whether relying on traditional methods of scholarship or exploring the potential of new technologies, the research presented in each symposium highlights the value of the manuscript book or document in understanding our intellectual heritage.

#### [SIMS/Katz Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8e3GREu0zuAjwQ0AXFYyRTg9Q6yf7LpU)
> YouTube playlist of lectures given by scholars hosted by the SIMS / Herbert D. Katz Center Distinguished Fellowship in Jewish Manuscript Studies. The fellowship, funded in part by the David Ruderman Distinguished Scholar fund, pairs a prominent scholar in any field of Jewish studies with a manuscript in one of our collections.

### Journal

#### [Manuscript Studies](https://mss.pennpress.org/home)
[<img style="padding: 10px" align="right" width="150" src="/sims-instruction/images/mss-51cover.jpg" alt="Cover image from MSS Issue 51">](https://mss.pennpress.org/home "Manuscript Studies")

> Manuscript Studies is a new journal that embraces the full complexity of global manuscript studies in the digital age. It has been conceived with four main goals in mind. First, to bridge the gaps between material and digital manuscript research; second, to break down the walls which often separate print and digital publication and serve as barriers between academics, professionals in the cultural heritage field, and citizen scholars; third, to serve as a forum for scholarship encompassing many pre-modern manuscripts cultures—not just those of Europe; and finally to showcase methods and techniques of analysis in manuscript studies that can be applied across different subject areas.
