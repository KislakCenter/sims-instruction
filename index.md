### About [SIMS](https://schoenberginstitute.org/about/)

Guided by the vision of its founder, Lawrence J. Schoenberg, the mission of SIMS at Penn is to bring manuscript culture, modern technology and people together to bring access to and understanding of our intellectual heritage locally and around the world.

We advance the mission of SIMS by:

- developing our own projects,
- supporting the scholarly work of others both at Penn and elsewhere, and
- collaborating with and contributing to other manuscript-related initiatives around the world.
