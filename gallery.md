>Originally exhibited March 1-August 16, 2013, this exhibit showcases the Schoenberg Collection of manuscripts held at the University of Pennsylvania. Each section of the exhibition - Arts and Sciences, Communication, Design, Education, Engineering, Law, the Medical Arts, and Social Policy and Practice - showcases texts, textbooks, documents, and letters that embody the history and mission of the schools that form the University. Often illustrated with complex diagrams and stunning imagery, the manuscripts bring to the present the intellectual legacy of the distant past.
