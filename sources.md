This is the Sources page, where you can explore resources that can help you
find digital surrogates and metadata for manuscripts.

### [BiblioPhilly](http://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/)

[<img style="padding: 10px" align="right" width="300" src="/sims-instruction/images/bibphil.jpg" alt="FLP Widener 1 f. 64v">](http://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/ "BiblioPhilly Interface")

>The Philadelphia region is home to a large number of libraries with truly outstanding special collections, most of whom are members of the Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries ([PACSCL](https://pacscl.org/)). Fifteen of these libraries have catalogued and digitized 450 medieval Western European manuscripts with the generous support of the Council on Library and Information Resources ([CLIR](https://www.clir.org/)), via its Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives initiative. All images have been released into the public domain. The [BiblioPhilly website](http://bibliophilly.library.upenn.edu/) provides access to the medieval manuscripts of Philadelphia — books written entirely by hand, and often gloriously illuminated with sumptuous pictures.

### [Digital Beehive](https://kislakcenter.github.io/digital-beehive/)

>The Digital Beehive is a web interface that serves as both a digital representation and host of digital tools for researching and working with Pastorius’s manuscript and its system of cross-referencing.The Digital Beehive lies at the nexus of manuscript studies and digital humanities. Not quite an aggregated database nor a digital edition, this project pushes our understanding of the digital humanities in new directions, as our datasets ultimately serve to replicate, reveal, and share a hyperlinked data system developed by a single author in the Early Modern period in manuscript form.

### [OPenn: Digital Primary Resources](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/)

[<img style="padding: 10px" align="right" width="300" src="/sims-instruction/images/openn.jpg" alt="OPenn landing page">](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/ "OPenn")

> OPenn contains complete sets of high-resolution archival images of
cultural heritage material from the collections of its contributing
institutions, along with machine-readable descriptive and technical
metadata. All materials on OPenn are in the public domain or released
under Creative Commons licenses as Free Cultural Works. Please see
specific repository pages and documents for applicable license terms.
The data on OPenn is intended for aggregators, digital humanists, and
scholars who have been directed here to procure high-resolution images
of manuscript pages. It is presented in a manner most likely to ensure
its long-term digital preservation. Many of the images here are
available via more user-friendly page-turning applications on
institutional websites. See [individual repository pages](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Repositories.html) for details.

### [Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (SDBM)](https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/)

[<img style="padding: 10px" align="right" width="300" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/pn6H0I4sS4Q/0.jpg" alt="Link to YouTube Introductory webinar">](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn6H0I4sS4Q "Introductory Webinar")

> The SDBM aggregates observations of pre-modern manuscripts from
historical and contemporary sources that document the sales and
locations of these books from around the world. Entries in the SDBM
assist researchers in locating and identifying particular manuscripts,
establishing provenance, and collecting descriptive information about
specific classes or types of manuscripts. Our user community includes scholars, librarians,
booksellers, students, collectors, and others who care about manuscripts
and want to contribute to our shared knowledge of their histories. This [introductory webinar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn6H0I4sS4Q) provides a basic introduction to the database. It includes
an explanation of the SDBM's development history and data model,
followed by demonstrations of the user interface and search strategies. This webinar was recorded
on May 19, 2020 with a live audience and includes their questions at the
end.
